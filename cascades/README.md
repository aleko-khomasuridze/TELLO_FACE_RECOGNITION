# Cascades Folder for Easy Use

This repository includes a "cascades" folder that contains Haar Cascade classifiers XML files. It's important to note that these XML files are not created or owned by the repository owner. Instead, they are part of the OpenCV library and are included here for easy use.

## About Haar Cascade Classifiers

Haar Cascade classifiers are a machine learning-based approach used for object detection. OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, provides a collection of pre-trained Haar Cascade XML files that can be used for various object detection tasks.

## Usage

The "cascades" folder within this repository includes some of the commonly used Haar Cascade XML files for face detection and other purposes. To use these classifiers, you can reference them in your OpenCV-based projects. Please make sure to respect OpenCV's licensing terms and conditions when using these files.

## Disclaimer
